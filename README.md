## Justification for Using Scalable Computing Methods

1. Volume of Data
The Landsat dataset comprises decades of satellite imagery, capturing vast geographical areas with high temporal frequency. Analyzing this data manually is not feasible due to its sheer volume. Scalable computing methods, such as cloud computing and distributed processing, enable us to handle and analyze large datasets efficiently.

2. High-Resolution Analysis
Detecting mining activities requires high-resolution analysis to distinguish between different land use types accurately. This precision demands significant computational power, which can be achieved using scalable methods like GPU computing and parallel processing.

3. Model Training and Evaluation
Developing a robust machine learning model necessitates training on large datasets to ensure accuracy and generalizability. This process involves numerous iterations and fine-tuning, which are computationally intensive. Scalable computing allows for faster training and evaluation, reducing the overall project timeline.

4. Real-Time Monitoring
For the model to be effective in real-world applications, it must be capable of real-time monitoring. This requires processing and analyzing new satellite images as they become available. Scalable computing infrastructures can support continuous data ingestion and real-time analysis, making timely interventions possible.
